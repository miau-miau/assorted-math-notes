>Let $A$ and $B$ be events with $\textnormal{P}(A)>0$. The **conditional [[probability-introduction|probability]]** of $B$ given $A$ is
>$$\textnormal{P}(B\mid A)=\frac{\textnormal{P}(A\cap B)}{\textnormal{P}(A)}$$
>>[!example]
>>A fair coin is tossed five times. Find the probability of obtaining at most one head given that at least one head appears.
>>
>>Let $B$ be the event "at most one head".
>>Let $A$ be the event "at least one head".
>>Then $A\cap B$ is the event "exactly one head".
>>$\textnormal{P}(A)=1-\textnormal{P}(\textnormal{no heads})=1-\frac{1}{2^5}=\frac{31}{32}$
>>$\textnormal{P}(B\cap A)=\frac{\binom{5}{1}}{2^5}=\frac{5}{32}$
>>$\textnormal{P}(B\mid A)=\frac{5:32}{31:32}=\frac{5}{31}$
