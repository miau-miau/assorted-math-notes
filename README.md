One of the endlessly alluring aspects of mathematics is that its thorniest paradoxes have a way of blooming into beautiful theories.

Mathematics is beautiful, and notes should be too. That's why this collection includes:
-  🖊️ Neat LaTeX proofs and equations
-  📝 Beautifully organized definitions, side-notes, and examples
-  🔗 Lots of backlinks for effective search
-  📐 Visually appealing tikz diagrams and drawings (plugin required)

At this moment, it roughly follows "Discrete Mathematics with Graph Theory 3rd ed" by Edgar G. Goodaire and Michael M. Parmenter, but will be expanded over time.

Tips:
- For the best reading experience, [tikz plugin](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-tikzjax) is recommended.
- Sort notes by "order-tag" (in Properties) to read them in recommended order.
