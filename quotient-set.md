>The set of all [[equivalence-class|equivalence classes]] is called the **quotient set of $A\textnormal{ mod }\sim$**. It is denoted by $A/\sim=\{ \bar{a}\mid a\in A \}$.
>>[!example]
>>Let $A$ be a set of all people, and $a\sim b$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same eye color.
>>Then $A/\sim=\{ \textnormal{ \{people with blue eyes\}, \{people with green eyes\},}\dots \}$
