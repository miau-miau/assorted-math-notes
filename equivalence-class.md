>Let $\sim$ be an [[equivalence-relation|equivalence relation]] on $A$, and let $a\in A$. The **equivalence class** of $a$ is the [[sets-naive#Subsets|subset]] of $A$:
>$$\bar{a}=\{ x\in A\mid x\sim a \}$$

>>Let $A$ be a set of all people, and $a\sim b$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same eye color. If Mary has blue eyes, then

The equivalence classes of $A$ are *disjoint* and the union of them is $A$. This is called a [[partition-of-sets|partition]] of $A$. It is true in general.
